# Migrating from `react-use`

One of `@react-hookz/web`'s primary goals is to replace [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use), the no longer maintained project `@react-hookz/web` grew out of.

## A note on missing hooks

Many of `react-use`'s hooks have already been ported to `@react-hookz/web`. You can track our work in [this issue](https://github.com/react-hookz/web/issues/33).

If there is a `react-use` hook you need that isn't ported yet, please comment there - or even better, make a PR!

In the mean time, **feel free to use both `@react-hookz/web` and `react-use` in tandem**.
