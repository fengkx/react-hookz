<Meta title="State/useMap" component={Example} />

# useMap

Tracks the state of a `Map`.

- Returned map does not change between renders.
- 1-to-1 signature with the native `Map` object, but its methods are wrapped to cause
  components to rerender with changes.  
  Otherwise, it is the JavaScript native `Map` object.
- SSR-friendly.

#### Example

<Canvas>
  <Story story={Example} inline />
</Canvas>

## Reference

```ts
export function useMap<K = any, V = any>(entries?: readonly (readonly [K, V])[] | null): Map<K, V>;
```

#### Arguments

- **entries** _`readonly (readonly [K, V])[] | null`_ - Initial entries iterator for underlying
  `Map` constructor.

#### Return

- `Map` instance.
